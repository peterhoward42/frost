    o  tidy up web gui to show paul and carl etc
        o  Unit tests for model view interaction?
            *  Quick start url
            *  Playground canned example rendering incl default side by side mode
            *  Playground refresh in side by side mode
                *  main form action is copied from incoming url
                *  input panel shows input from form
                *  output panel shows converted input
                *  switch to says tabbed
                *  switch to form action is to tabbed
            o  Playground refresh in tabbed mode input in front
                *  switch to gives label and action to go to side by side
                *  The input tab is active vs output
                *  if we asked for input in front, it is visible and active
                o  The hrefs on both tabs are refreshes with the right tab in front
                    *  Experiment making the <LI> in the tabs a btn (not allowed)
                    *  How else organise these two button side by side
                    o  If works DI stuff that should be
                    o  If works, fix up regression tests
                    o  Then revert to checking each btn has corect url
                o  if we asked for output in front it is visible and active
            o  Playground refresh in tabbed mode output in front




                o  Tests that show refresh works from this starting point
                o  Tests that show you can switch to tabbed mode and it displays right
                o  Tests that show, that tabbed mode is preserved by refresh
                o  Tests that show, that choice of tabs is preserved by refresh
                o  You can edit the input text and press refresh and it works cyclicly
                o  The type something entry point works and supports refresh
                o  CSV entry point
        o  Manual exercise of playground gui and going back and forth to quickstart


        o  unfinished links do something more sensible

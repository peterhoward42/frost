                    o  Make sure link from landing to playground works
                    o  What unit tests should there be

            o  strings in main should be constants
            o  model builders in main should go into models
            o  make sure no unused handlers left behind
            o  does this mean the other playground choices should follow?

        o  unfinished links do something more sensible
        o  edit/refresh cycle should work
        o  try something should work

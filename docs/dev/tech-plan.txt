*  Anticipate urls for landing page and for playground landing
*  code the current html thus
*  Update handlers so both produce same page but indi
*  Make default handler also go to quickstart/python
*  Refactor template parsing to in common
o  Make active nav show if in quickstart or playground
o  Decide how to split off and delegate rendering of these two pages


o  Get the tab-like navigation mechanism working
o  Use the playground page as a driving use case...
o  Focus first on space-delimitted format
o  Make example button show  a small fragment of example space-delim content
   on the left hand side, launches the converter, and shows the JSON on
   the right. Start with a converter that creates just {} for result.
o  Gradually evolve the space delim conversion to do the real job - using
   unit-test-driven steps (uTDD). The GUI will keep up without any separate
   work because it will already be plumbed-in.
